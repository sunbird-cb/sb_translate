        <div> Users can choose their Ministry/Department/Organization
            to specify what they need. This helps ensure that the
            content generated is relevant and fits their specific entity.
            Additionally, users can select their level/role within their
            chosen entity to further customize the content to meet
            their specific responsibilities and requirements. The
            system also considers the user's preferred language, so
            they can choose how they want the content to be
            presented. This means the generated content will be in a
            language that the user understands comfortably. Once the
            user makes their selections, the system automatically
            creates tailored content based on their context, role, and
            language preference. This content can include various
            materials like documents, reports, guidelines, and training
            materials.If the user chooses a language different from the
            default language of the content, the system will smoothly
            translate the generated content into the selected
            language. This allows officials to access the content in
            their preferred language, promoting better understanding
            and communication.
            The user interface (UI) for this feature is integrated with
            the IGOT Portals. These are online platforms used for
            government training and information sharing. The
            integration ensures that the generated and translated
            content is readily available within the existing IGOT
            Portals. This makes it easy for officials to access and use
            the content for their training and reference needs.
            ● Set up the Angular project and integrate it with the
necessary backends and APIs.
● Develop the frontend components, services, and UI
elements for user selection, content display, and
language preferences.
● Implement the server-side logic for content generation
based on user selections.
● Integrate with the translation service or third-party
translation API for translating the generated content.
● Test the integration with backends and ensure smooth
communication between frontend and backend
components.
